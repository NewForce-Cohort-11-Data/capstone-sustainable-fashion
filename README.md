# Price, Sustainability Ratings & Consumer Interest in Fashion
### *A Data-Driven Analysis Using Good On You, Google Trends, and Transparency Index Scores*
## Motivation

Sustainable fashion is gaining attention as more people learn about pollution, overproduction, and labor issues in the fashion industry. At the same time, many assume that sustainable brands cost more or are harder to access.
I wanted to understand whether that is actually true and whether consumer interest aligns with real sustainability performance.

This project uses brand ratings, price levels, and search behavior to explore how sustainability compares with what people actually look for online.

## Questions

1. How are fashion brands distributed across Good On You sustainability ratings

2. How do price levels compare across different sustainability rating categories

3. How does consumer interest in sustainable fashion (Google Trends) compare to interest in fast-fashion brands

## Acquiring and Normalizing the Data

I collected brand information by scraping the Good On You directory. Since every brand page is formatted differently, I cleaned and normalized the data so ratings and price levels could be compared clearly.

Google Trends was used to collect search interest for sustainable fashion terms and fast-fashion brands like Shein, H&M, and Zara.
The search scores were normalized so different terms could be compared on the same scale.

## Problems and Challenges

Sustainable fashion is a very broad topic, and finding consistent data was one of the biggest challenges.

Some of the main issues included:

- scraping data from pages that used different layouts

- cleaning brand information where price levels or ratings were missing

- deciding what data to keep since sustainability covers many areas

- narrowing the scope so the project focused on ratings, price, and search interest

## Technologies Used

**Python** for scraping, cleaning, and analysis

**Pandas** for working with the dataset

**Google** Trends for search interest data

**Excel** for organizing and checking data

**PowerPoint** for presenting the results

**Git** for version control
